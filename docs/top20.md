# **TOP 20 tools every Blue Teamer should have in 2020**

Hi Peerlysters,

 A few days ago, I wrote a piece called &quot;**[TOP 20 tools every security professional should have in 2020](https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/top-20-tools-every-security-professional-should-have-in-2020-chiheb-chebbi?trk=search_page_search_result)**&quot; where I presented some of the most helpful and required tools in information security that you need to acquire. Most of the presented tools were usually used for offensive purposes. So, I am taking this opportunity to present the TOP 20  free tools that every blue teamer should have in 2020:

![](RackMultipart20200926-4-1rlrx7g_html_3630655a2aaef65a.png)

Forensics imaging is a very important task in digital forensics. Imaging is copying the data carefully with ensuring its integrity and without leaving out a file because it is very critical to protect the evidence and make sure that it is properly handled. That is why there is a difference between normal file copying and imaging. Imaging is capturing the entire drive. When imaging the drive, the analyst image the entire physical volume including the master boot record. One of the used tools is &quot;AccessData FTK Imager&quot;.
