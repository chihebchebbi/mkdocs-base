**Note: \*\*****  **This article will be updated with more web application attacks \*\* in the next days

## Web Application Overview

Before diving deep into [how to](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/how-to) attack and secure Web Applications, we need to dissect what web applications really are. An application by definition is a program that performs specific tasks. We are using many applications on a daily basis like eBooks readers, Trading platforms, emailing applications and so on. [Web applications](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Web-application-Web-app) are stored on a remote server and delivered over the [Internet](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/internet)through a browser interface.

Web applications are developed based on many different architectures. The following is a simple example of them.

## HTTP Headers

[HTTP Headers](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/http-headers) are allowing the [exchange](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/exchange-2014) of information between Generally we have 4 types of [HTTP](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/http) headers:

- General-header
- Client Request-header
- Server Response-header
- Entity-header

To learn more about HTTP headers I highly recommend you to read this great Peerlyst Post from Brad Voris: **[HTTP Headers for the Security Professional](https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/http-headers-for-the-security-professional-brad-voris?trk=search_page_search_result)****, ****  ** where he explained in a detailed way the different HTTP Headers

## Web Application Attacks

![](RackMultipart20200926-4-i1kaba_html_9ee88df06b4f2c00.png)

By now, we discovered some important terminologies in web applications. Let&#39;s explore some of the most well-known web application attacks and vulnerabilities. There many web attacks but we are going to only explore some of them.

## XSS (Cross-site scripting)

In [Cross-site scripting](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cross-site-scripting-1) (XSS) attacks the criminal can inject [malicious](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/malicious) [scripts](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/scripts) into the web application which help him bypass restriction, [steal](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/steal) [credentials](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/credentials), [Hijack](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/hijack) [sessions](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/sessions), and many other malicious activities. If you want to test if a web page is vulnerable to [XSS attacks](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/xss-attacks), for example, find an input field and print anything like &quot;This is a Test&quot;. If it appears on the webpage then the page is vulnerable. Another case, insert

This graph illustrates how the Attacker can [Exploit](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/exploit) [Cross-site scripting](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cross-site-scripting-1) (XSS) vulnerability:

![](RackMultipart20200926-4-i1kaba_html_d502f4b0a2ecd661.png)

_source:__ _[_https://dejanstojanovic.net/media/215060/xss.png_](https://dejanstojanovic.net/media/215060/xss.png)

Cross-site [scripting](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/scripting) (XSS) attacks categories are:

- **Persistent XSS** , where the malicious input originates from the website&#39;s database.
- **Reflected XSS** , where the malicious input originates from the victim&#39;s request.
- **DOM-based XSS** , where the [vulnerability](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/vulnerability) is in the client-side code rather than the server-side code. ( [https://excess-xss.com/](https://excess-xss.com/))

## SQL Injection

This is a server-side attack that takes advantage of [vulnerabilities](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/vulnerabilities) in web applications to send [unauthorized](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/unauthorized) [database](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/database) queries. During this web attack, the attacker extracts [sensitive information](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/sensitive-information) like [passwords](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/passwords) and business data by [manipulating](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/manipulating) the data to cause their own database query to execute, allowing them to read or modify the contents of the database

![](RackMultipart20200926-4-i1kaba_html_7fad7c6a9a1fd0f6.png)

_Source:__ _[_https://www.guru99.com/images/EthicalHacking/Article\_13\_7.png_](https://www.guru99.com/images/EthicalHacking/Article_13_7.png)

There are many [SQL injection attack](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/sql-injection-attack) categories:

- **Error-Based SQL injection**
- **Union-Based SQL injection**
-
### Blind SQL injection:


  -
### Time-based SQLi
  -
### Boolean-based SQLi

## NoSQL Injection

NoSQL is an approach to database design that can accommodate a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, columnar and graph formats. NoSQL, which stands for &quot;not only SQL,&quot; is an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables and data schema is carefully designed before the [database](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/database) is built. NoSQL databases are especially useful for working with large sets of distributed data [Source: [https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget/) ]

Non-relational databases can be categorized into 4 major categories:

- **Document-oriented**
- **Column Family**
- **Key value stores**
- **Graph databases.**

One of the biggest [threats](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/threats) to NoSQL is &quot;NoSQL injection&quot;. [Malicious](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/malicious) inputs could be a huge problem even we are no longer dealing with the query language. In this small Demonstration done by [Pete Corey](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2017/07/03/what-is-nosql-injection/) He delivered a short [vulnerable](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/vulnerable) [code](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/code):

If you type admin as [username](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/username) and {$gte: &quot;&quot;} as [Password](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/password) the result query will be the following:

db.users.findOne({ [username](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/username): &quot;admin&quot;, hashedPassword: {$gte: &quot;&quot;}})

and this query will return the first document it finds with a username of &quot;admin&quot; and a hashed [password](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/password) that is greater an empty string. The full reading is here: [http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2017/07/03/what-is-nosql-injection/](http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2017/07/03/what-is-nosql-injection/)

[Testing](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/testing) for NoSQL [injection](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/injection): [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing\_for\_NoSQL\_injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection)

These are some [Payload](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/payload) you can use them for [testing](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/testing) purposes; [Payloads](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/payloads) All The Things: [https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20injection](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20injection)

To learn more you can check this great presentation:

- [https://www.owasp.org/images/e/ed/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf](https://www.owasp.org/images/e/ed/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf)

To defend against [SQL](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/sql) / NoSQL Injection [Chetan Karande](https://github.com/ckarande) from [OWASP](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/owasp) organization suggest the following steps:

- Prepared Statements: For SQL calls, use [prepared statements](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/prepared-statements) instead of building dynamic queries using string concatenation.
- [Input Validation](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/input-validation): Validate inputs to detect malicious values. For NoSQL databases, also validate input types against expected types
- Least Privilege: To minimize the potential damage of a successful [injection](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/injection) attack, do not assign [DBA](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dba) or admin type access [rights](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/rights) to your application accounts. Similarly, minimize the privileges of the [operating system](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/operating-system) account that the database process runs under.

## LFI (Local file inclusion)

[Local file inclusion](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/local-file-inclusion) is an attack where the criminal manipulate the web application to include files on the web server (only include local files) because later we are going to explore  **Remote file inclusion****  **where the attacker uses remote files.

You can find many [scanners](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/scanners) in this Peerlyst Post: [Pentest tools: LFI scanners and exploiters](https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/pentest-tools-lfi-scanners-and-exploiters-karl-m-1?trk=search_page_search_result)

## RFI (Remote file inclusion)

In a [Remote file inclusion](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/remote-file-inclusion), the attacker [exploits](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/exploits) a [weakness](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/weakness) in the web application that dynamically includes external files. If a developer leave inputs without properly sanitizing them will make the attacker easily passing them into file include commands. To defend against Remote file inclusion you need to maintain a _whitelist_ of files that can be included.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cross-site-request-forgery) is an attack where the attacker needs to be authenticated in order to trick the [victim](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/victim) to perform malicious activities. This attack can be done by tricking the victim into clicking a specific link via many techniques like [Social engineering](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/social-engineering)which is a technique to manipulate and exploit the psychological aspects of the target. Finally, the attacker sends a forged request to the victim then the website will validate that request.

## Directory Traversal

In this attack, the attacker tries to access restricted directories. Sometimes this attack is called Path Traversal. Attackers use  **../****   **to go to an upper folder. They can duplicate those symbols until they find the folders. To defend against [Directory traversal](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/directory-traversal) you need to validate user input from browsers.

## OS Command Injection

In this attack, the attacker, as usual, exploit non-sanitized input fields to insert [operating systems](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/operating-systems) commands to run them on the server [operating system](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/operating-system) which make them able to manipulate the files.

## Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

A web application firewall (WAF) is a security solution that filters out bad HTTP traffic between a client and web application. It is a common [security control](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/security-control) to help you protect your web application security. Most Web application firewalls are helping you to defend against many of the previously discussed web application vulnerabilities (XSS, [SQLi](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/sqli) and so on)

![](RackMultipart20200926-4-i1kaba_html_546b543279917ff0.png)

_source: web-application-firewall.png_

They can operate on 2 different modes:

- **A whitelisting model**
- **A blacklisting model****  **

This is a good list of WAFs: ** ** [A List of Open Source Web Application Firewalls (WAF&#39;s)](https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/resource-a-list-of-open-source-web-application-firewalls-waf-s-s-delano?trk=search_page_search_result)

## Web Vulnerability Scanners

To Test the [security posture](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/security-posture) of web application you can use a wide range of Web app [vulnerability scanners](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/vulnerability-scanners) like:

- [w3af - Open Source Web Application Security Scanner:](http://w3af.org/)

[w3af](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/w3af) is a  **Web Application Attack and Audit Framework**. The project&#39;s goal is to create a [framework](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/framework) to help you secure your web applications by finding and exploiting all web application vulnerabilities.
